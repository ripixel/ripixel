**Hi, I'm James King, and I make things for the web. As you can probably tell, I'm a fan of minimalist designs that help you get the information you need, with the minimum of fuss.**

**I also really, really like big, bold, oh-my-gosh-that's-so-bright colours.**

## A little more about me

I'm James King, a 28 year old Software Engineer from Lincolnshire, who has an affinity for Coca-Cola, bacon, and being pretty bad at boardgames despite my intense love of them.

I suppose we should talk about where I've worked. This bit might sound a little more professional...

### Deliveroo

_December 2020 - Present_ | **Senior Software Engineer**

Deliveroo have many facets to their operation, and one that's not immediately obvious to outsiders is that of "Care" - what happens after you place your order. It's an integral part of a great customer experience, and one that Deliveroo takes incredibly seriously.

I am part of the Care Engineering team, looking after these various microservices (both frontend and backend) across various languages, keeping up with the latest technology as a company at the scale of Deliveroo must do, while creating advancements at the break-neck speed that an industry leader and disruptor demands.

### DVELP

_June 2019 - November 2020_ | **Senior Software Engineer**

DVELP is a company obsessed with creating real change in the communications space, especially around contact centres. To this end, they use Twilio and Google AI capabilities to create amazing experiences, both for contact centre agents and customers alike.

I was as a full-stack (Node/TypeScript/React) Senior Software Engineer, helping deliver client solutions through our professional services offering, as well as assisting with business functions on a day-to-day basis. I feel honoured to be included in many high-level business operations and decision making - DVELP truly is a company run by everyone it employs, not just that of some god-like "Senior Leadership Team".

I also had the responsibility of InfoSec officer for the company, meaning there's lots of "fun" forms and questionnaires to fill out on a regular basis, as well as internal and external audits.

For the last 6 months of my employment, I was also effectively acting Head of Engineering for the DVELP practice within the parent company Sabio; being involved in all facets of business delivery, including sales, support, hiring, scoping, client communications, technical direction, and actually engineering solutions.
